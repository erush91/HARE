~~ Picking A Name ~~

Python module/package names should generally follow the following constraints:
* All lowercase
* Unique on pypi, even if you don’t want to make your package publicly available (you might want to specify it privately as a dependency later)
* Underscore-separated or no word separators at all (don’t use hyphens)

~~ Structure ~~

The initial directory structure for funniest should look like this:

marchhare/
    marchhare/
        __init__.py
    setup.py

The top level directory is the root of our SCM repo, e.g. "marchhare.git". The subdir, also called "marchhare", is the actual Python module.

~~ setup.py ~~

The main setup config file, "setup.py", should contain a single call to 'setuptools.setup()', like so:

setup(name='marchhare',
      version='2017.06.25',
      description='The funniest joke in the world',
      url='http://github.com/storborg/funniest',
      author='Flying Circus',
      author_email='flyingcircus@example.com',
      license='MIT',
      packages=['funniest'],
      zip_safe=False)

~~ Local Installation ~~

Now we can install the package locally (for use on our system), with:
 pip install .

~~ .pypirc ~~

This is located at ~/.pypirc

[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
repository: http://www.eng.utah.edu/~jwatson/marchhare-2017.6.25.tar.gz
username: jwatson_edu
password: ********

~~ Registration ~~

1. Install twine
sudo -H pip install twine

The setup.py script is also our main entrypoint to register the package name on PyPI and upload source distributions.

To “register” the package (this will reserve the name, upload package metadata, and create the pypi.python.org webpage):

term$> twine upload dist/marchhare-2017.6.25.tar.gz

If you haven’t published things on PyPI before, you’ll need to create an account following the steps provided at this point.
